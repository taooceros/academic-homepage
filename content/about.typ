Hi there!

I am Hongtao, a student from #link("https://www.washington.edu/")[UW] and #link("https://www.wisc.edu/")[UW]. 

I am a first year PhD student in the #link("https://www.cs.washington.edu/")[Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering] at University of Washington, advised by #link("https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/arvind")[Arvind Krishnamurthy] in the amazing #link("https://syslab.cs.washington.edu/")[System Lab]. We also collaborate extensively with #link("https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mgliu/")[Ming Liu].

I build systems that exploit the hardware potential via software. My current research focus are in creating an abstraction over the SmartNICs and the hardware resources on top of it. During my undergrad, I created locks that achieves both #link("https://research.cs.wisc.edu/wind/Publications/eurosys20-scl.pdf", [usage fairness]) and high throughput based on delegation.

Prior to joining UW, I received my B.S. with Honors in _Computer Science_ and _Mathematics_ from University of Wisconsin-Madison, under the guidance of the wonderful #link("https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/")[Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau]. I also have the great fortune to meet and be friends with many other cool professors there: #link("https://wrightstephen.github.io/sw_proj/", [Stephen Wright]), #link("https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dieter/")[Dieter van Melkebeek], #link("https://www.ewbates.com/")[Erik Bates], #link("https://people.math.wisc.edu/~apisa/")[Paul Apisa], and many more... (Curious? Check out #link("blog/uw-madison-course"))

I have the great fortune to be part of the amazing #link("https://flowlauncher.com")[Flow Launcher] team, where we are trying to create the best application launcher for windows.
