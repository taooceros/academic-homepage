Hi there!

I am Hongtao, a PhD student at #link("https://www.washington.edu/")[UW] advised by the fantastic #link("https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/arvind")[Arvind Krishnamurthy]. We work closely with #link("https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mgliu/")[Ming Liu]. I was a undergrad at the other #link("https://www.wisc.edu/")[UW] advised by the amazing #link("https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi")[Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau].

My current research focus lies in scalable synchronization, high-performance networking, and abstraction over emerging heterogeneous hardware with focus on asynchrony.

I have the great fortune to be part of the wonderful #link("https://flowlauncher.com")[Flow Launcher] team, where we are trying to create the best application launcher for Windows.
