Hi there!

I am Hongtao, a student from #link("https://www.washington.edu/")[UW] and #link("https://www.wisc.edu/")[UW].

I am a first year PhD student in the #link("https://www.cs.washington.edu/")[Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering] at University of Washington, advised by #link("https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/arvind")[Arvind Krishnamurthy] in the amazing #link("https://syfi.cs.washington.edu/")[Syfi Lab]. We also collaborate extensively with #link("https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mgliu/")[Ming Liu].

I build systems that exploit the hardware potential via software. My current research focus lies in scalable synchronization, high-performance networking, and abstraction over emerging heterogeneous hardware. I believe asynchrony is the key to unlock the performance of modern hardware, and there should be a unified programming interface across diverse asynchrony mechanisms (e.g., interrupts, polling, DMA, etc.).

Prior to joining UW, I received my B.S. with Honors in _Computer Science_ and _Mathematics_ from University of Wisconsin-Madison, under the guidance of the wonderful #link("https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/")[Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau]. During my undergrad, I created locks that achieves both #link("https://research.cs.wisc.edu/wind/Publications/eurosys20-scl.pdf", [usage fairness]) and high throughput based on delegation. I also have the great fortune to meet and be friends with many other cool professors there: #link("https://wrightstephen.github.io/sw_proj/", [Stephen Wright]), #link("https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dieter/")[Dieter van Melkebeek], #link("https://www.ewbates.com/")[Erik Bates], #link("https://people.math.wisc.edu/~apisa/")[Paul Apisa], and many more... (Curious? Check out #link("blog/uw-madison-course"))

I have the great fortune to be part of the amazing #link("https://flowlauncher.com")[Flow Launcher] team, where we are trying to create the best application launcher for windows.
