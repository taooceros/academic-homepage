Hi there!

I am Hongtao, a PhD student at #link("https://www.washington.edu/")[UW] advised by the fantastic #link("https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/arvind")[Arvind Krishnamurthy]. We work closely with #link("https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mgliu/")[Ming Liu].

My current research focus lies in scalable synchronization, high-performance interconnects, and abstraction over emerging heterogeneous hardware with asynchrony.

I am a member of the wonderful #link("https://flowlauncher.com")[Flow Launcher] team, where we are trying to create the best application launcher for Windows. I was a undergrad at the other #link("https://www.wisc.edu/")[UW] advised by the amazing #link("https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi")[Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau] and #link("https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ypatel/")[Yuvraj Patel], and learnt from and be friends with #link("https://wrightstephen.github.io/sw_proj/", [Stephen Wright]), #link("https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dieter/")[Dieter van Melkebeek], #link("https://www.ewbates.com/")[Erik Bates], #link("https://people.math.wisc.edu/~apisa/")[Paul Apisa], and many more... // (Curious?
