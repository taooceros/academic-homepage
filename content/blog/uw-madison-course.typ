There are a lot of fun learning at UW-Madison. I will sort them based on the subjects.

= Math

One of the surpising thing is that UW-Madison has a very strong math department. I personally like the probability theory and stochastic process the most (@probability-theory and @stochastic-process). They are all taught by Prof. Erik Bates (https://www.ewbates.com/). Unfortunately, he is no longer in UW-Madison, but in NCSU.

The hardest math course I took is the Modern Algebra II (@modern-algebra-ii), taught by Prof. Paul Apisa (https://people.math.wisc.edu/~apisa/).

I did take one of the calculus course (Multivariable Calculus, Math 234), but I did not find it very interesting and worth a section. One of my friends took the honors version (Math 375 + 376) which combines calculus and linear algebra and he said it is much more interesting.

== Linear Algebra (341)

This is the first math course that I found very interesting in UW-Madison. It is taught by Prof. Sigurd Angenent (https://people.math.wisc.edu/~angenent/). The textbook we used is #link("https://www.math.brown.edu/streil/papers/LADW/LADW.html")[Linear Algebra Done Wrong] by Sergei Treil. Prof. Angenent is a very profound math professor. He knows many things about the math history and explains the concept in a very clear way (yet a bit slow, but I won't complain as I suffers so much in Math 542 which is taught really fast). I find the most rewarding part of the course is that it combines the abstract math theory with concrete usage.

The first part that is very interesting is that it views matrix as the representation of linear transformation, which explains why matrix multiplication is defined the way it is.

Another part I like very much is the spectrum theorem and the eigenvalue decomposition, and how it can be used to compute matrix power.
